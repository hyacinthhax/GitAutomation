# GitAutomation

This Program uses these requirements:
sys
OS
time
Selenium
GPGME

To run:
python create.py

Description:
This program is based on KalleHallden's Automated git process. I used my own twist and added a gpg program to easily conceal a password instead of plaintext. It's very simple and with schedule can be applied to do so much more.
